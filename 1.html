				<h1>Impacts on human health</h1>
				<ul class="list">
					<li>
						
						
							The complex composition and improper handling of e-waste adversely affect human health. A growing body of epidemiological and clinical evidence has led to increased concern about the potential threat of e-waste to human health, especially in developing countries such as India and China. The primitive methods used by unregulated backyard operators (e.g., the informal sector) to reclaim, reprocess, and recycle e-waste materials expose the workers to a number of toxic substances. Processes such as dismantling components, wet chemical processing, and incineration are used and result in direct exposure and inhalation of harmful chemicals. Safety equipment such as gloves, face masks, and ventilation fans are virtually unknown, and workers often have little idea of what they are handling.

						<p>
							For instance, in terms of health hazards, open burning of printed wiring boards increases the concentration of dioxins in the surrounding areas. These toxins cause an increased risk of cancer if inhaled by workers and local residents. Toxic metals and poison can also enter the bloodstream during the manual extraction and collection of tiny quantities of precious metals, and workers are continuously exposed to poisonous chemicals and fumes of highly concentrated acids. Recovering resalable copper by burning insulated wires causes neurological disorders, and acute exposure to cadmium, found in semiconductors and chip resistors, can damage the kidneys and liver and cause bone loss. Long-term exposure to lead on printed circuit boards and computer and television screens can damage the central and peripheral nervous system and kidneys, and children are more susceptible to these harmful effects.

							Health Risks: E-waste often contains hazardous materials such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and brominated flame retardants. Exposure to these substances through improper handling or disposal can lead to serious health issues, including respiratory problems, neurological damage, reproductive issues, and even cancer.

					<li>
						<p>
							Informal Recycling Practices: In many parts of the world, especially in developing countries, e-waste recycling is often carried out informally by workers in unregulated facilities. These workers, often unaware of the health risks, are exposed to harmful substances through processes like burning and dismantling electronic components without proper protective gear.						</p>

					</li>


					<li>
						<p>
							Water and Soil Contamination: Improper disposal of e-waste can lead to the leaching of hazardous chemicals into groundwater and soil. This contamination can affect local communities' access to clean water sources and agricultural land, leading to long-term health consequences.						</p>
					<!--	<a href="blog.html" class="more">Read more&gt;&gt;</a>-->
					</li>


					<li>
						<p>
							Air Pollution: Burning e-waste releases toxic fumes and particulate matter into the air, which can be inhaled by nearby residents. This air pollution contributes to respiratory problems and other health issues, especially in communities located near informal e-waste recycling sites.						</p>
					<!--	<a href="blog.html" class="more">Read more&gt;&gt;</a>-->
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Children's Health: Children are particularly vulnerable to the health effects of e-waste due to their developing bodies and increased exposure to contaminated environments. Children living near e-waste recycling sites may experience stunted growth, developmental delays, and other health problems as a result of exposure to hazardous substances.					<!--	<a href="blog.html" class="more">Read more&gt;&gt;</a>-->
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Occupational Hazards: Workers in the formal and informal e-waste recycling sectors are at risk of occupational hazards due to exposure to toxic chemicals and unsafe working conditions. Without proper training and protective measures, these workers are susceptible to acute and chronic health issues.					</li>
